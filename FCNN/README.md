# Fully Connected Neural Network

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/PRATEEKKUMARAGNIHOTRI/CMS-trigger/blob/master/images/FCNN%20architecture.PNG) | ![Validation](https://github.com/PRATEEKKUMARAGNIHOTRI/CMS-trigger/blob/master/images/validation_scheme.png) 

As opposed to vast hand-labelled features passed to LightGBM, FCNN only uses Angle phi, Angle theta and a mask ( to tell whether muon hit the given detector or not )
